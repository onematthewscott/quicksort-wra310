# Quicksort Algorithm
Quick sort algorithm is one of the most widely used sorting algorithms. It follows a divide and conquer paradigm. We usually use Recursion in quicksort implementation. In each recursive call, a pivot is chosen, then the array is partitioned in such a way that all the elements less than pivot lie to the left and all the elements greater than pivot lie to the right. - [source](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/quick-sort-algorithm/#quick-sort-pseudocode)

After every call, the chosen pivot occupies its correct position in the array which it is supposed to as in a sorted array. So with each step, our problem gets reduced by 2 which leads to quick sorting. Pivot can be an element. Example: last element of the current array or the first element of current array or random pivot etc.
